Creating a recurring event

Overview

After you create a recurrence rule, assign it to an event with the method of \texttt{EKEvent}.

Recurrence rules can have an end, represented by an \texttt{EKRecurrenceEnd} object. The end can be based on a specific date or a maximum number of occurrences.

        Note

        It is currently not possible to directly modify an \texttt{EKRecurrenceRule} or any of its properties. This functionality is achieved by creating a new \texttt{EKRecurrenceRule} and setting an event or reminder to use the newly created rule.

Topics

Creating a Basic Recurrence Rule

\texttt{EKSpan}

An object that indicates whether modifications should apply to a single event or all future events of a recurring event.

\texttt{- initRecurrenceWithFrequency: interval:end:}

Initializes and returns a simple recurrence rule with a given frequency, interval, and end.

Creating a Complex Recurrence Rule

\texttt{- initRecurrenceWithFrequency: interval:daysOfTheWeek: daysOfTheMonth:monthsOfThe
Year:weeksOfTheYear:daysOfTheYear:setPositions:end:}

Initializes and returns a recurrence rule with a given frequency and additional scheduling information.

Accessing Recurrence Rule Properties

\texttt{EKRecurrenceFrequency}

The frequency for recurrence rules.

\texttt{calendarIdentifier}

The identifier for the recurrence rule's calendar.

\texttt{recurrenceEnd}

Indicates when the recurrence rule ends.

\texttt{frequency}

The frequency of the recurrence rule.

\texttt{interval}

Specifies how often the recurrence rule repeats over the unit of time indicated by its frequency.

\texttt{firstDayOfTheWeek}

Indicates which day of the week the recurrence rule treats as the first day of the week.

\texttt{daysOfTheWeek}

The days of the week associated with the recurrence rule, as an array of \texttt{EKRecurrenceDayOfWeek} objects.

\texttt{daysOfTheMonth}

The days of the month associated with the recurrence rule, as an array of \texttt{NSNumber} objects.

\texttt{daysOfTheYear}

The days of the year associated with the recurrence rule, as an array of \texttt{NSNumber} objects.

\texttt{weeksOfTheYear}

The weeks of the year associated with the recurrence rule, as an array of \texttt{NSNumber} objects.

\texttt{monthsOfTheYear}

The months of the year associated with the recurrence rule, as an array of \texttt{NSNumber} objects.

\texttt{setPositions}

An array of ordinal numbers that filters which recurrences to include in the recurrence rule's frequency.

\texttt{EK\_LOSE\_FRACTIONAL\_SECONDS\_DO\_NOT\_USE}

A deprecated function.
