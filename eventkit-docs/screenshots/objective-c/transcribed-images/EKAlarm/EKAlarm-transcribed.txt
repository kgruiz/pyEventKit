Overview

An \texttt{EKAlarm} object represents an alarm in Event Kit. Use the \texttt{alarmWithAbsoluteDate:} and \texttt{alarmWith
RelativeOffset:} class methods to create an alarm and use the properties to set information about an alarm.
In macOS Mountain Lion, you can specify an action to trigger when the alarm fires via the \texttt{emailAddress},
\texttt{soundName}, or \texttt{url} property.
