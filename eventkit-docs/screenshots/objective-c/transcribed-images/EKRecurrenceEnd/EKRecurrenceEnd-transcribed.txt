Overview

The \texttt{EKRecurrenceEnd} class defines the end of a recurrence rule defined by an \texttt{EKRecurrenceRule} object.

The recurrence end can be specified by a date (date-based) or by a maximum count of occurrences (count- based). An event that is intended to continue indefinitely should have its \texttt{EKRecurrenceEnd} set to \texttt{nil}.
