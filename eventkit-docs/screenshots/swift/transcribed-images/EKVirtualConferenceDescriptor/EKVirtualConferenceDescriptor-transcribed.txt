Overview

When users add events to their calendars and use one of the room types that your provider defines, EventKit requests a virtual conference descriptor from your provider. Each virtual conference descriptor contains:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A user-visible name for the virtual conference
    \item One or more URLs that the users open to join the virtual conference
    \item Optional details about the conference that may be helpful to users
\end{itemize}

Calendar uses the first URL that you provide as the preferred way for users to join a virtual conference and displays additional URLs as links in the virtual conference details.

    \textbf{Important}
    
    Events that use your virtual conference descriptors may sync to other devices where your app isn't installed. To support links to your virtual conference regardless of whether your app is installed, adopt universal links in your app. Universal links let you specify HTTP URLs that open your app if it's installed or open a corresponding web page if it's not. For more information about adopting universal links in your app, see \href{Supporting universal links in your app}{Supporting universal links in your app}.
