\texttt{class EKRecurrenceDayOfWeek}

Mentioned in

\textbf{Creating a recurring event}

Overview

The \texttt{EKRecurrenceDayOfWeek} class represents a day of the week for use with an \texttt{EKRecurrenceRule} object.

A day of the week can optionally have a week number, indicating a specific day in the recurrence rule's frequency. For example, a day of the week with a day value of Tuesday and a week number of 2 would represent the second Tuesday of every month in a monthly recurrence rule, and the second Tuesday of every year in a yearly recurrence rule. A day of the week with a week number of 0 ignores its week number.
